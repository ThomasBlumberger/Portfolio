This software allows students to choose a coursework/groupwork to be a part of in order of preference, and if they are classed as at risk, where at risk students can't be paired together.
A convenor can add courseworks/modules and different groupworks in them for the user to choose.
It is a simple software made alongside 4 other students. We all played an equal part in this and spent 5 months creating this project.
There are instructions to install included.
